# RPN - Reverse Polish Notation 

Simple C++ application to solve arithmetic expressions using an implementation to shunting-yard algorithm.

It was an assignment project for the **Computing Systems Course** as part of a larger project to demonstrate the several stages inside a computer to perform calculations and logic.

## Details
- The code uses the standard C++ data structures.
- Double values are supported.
- -ve values are not supported.

---

I re-implemented the code in python for a different course **Advanced Computer Architecture**.
